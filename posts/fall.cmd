# Where the fall surge is starting

Even as the New York Times reports covid [cases at universities](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/covid-college-cases-tracker.html)
there's another trend starting, week-over-week growth in positive tests -- despite a drop in [testing](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/15/us/coronavirus-testing-decrease.html). It's easy to spot in the six surging states.

## This surge is in new counties

Looking at the split between increasing and decreasing positive tests, it's easy to spot that counties responsible for the surge earlier this month
are not dropping, while the new areas are rising rapidly.
