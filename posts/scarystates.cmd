# Some States are Getting Downright Scary

Covid is spreading rapidly in Western, Mid-Western, and Southern states. The table below ranks states
by how many are likely newly infectuous in the last week per capita.

[table 1 Likely infectuous in the last week per capita]

Montana, Wisconsin, South and North Dakota, and Utah all have over 1% of their population likely become infectious
*in the last week*! But those are absolute, what states are really spiking?

[table 2 Week over week change in infectuous people per capita]

This table show states ranked by the weekly change in per capita infectious population. Not only is did over
1% of Montanans become infectuous last week, that's up nearly 3/4 of a percent than the week before. 
Wisconsin also is a double loser here, followed by big infectuousness increases in Kentucky, Deleware, and Idaho.

Sadly, deaths are showing up in these regions as well, with deaths spiking in the Dakotas, Missouri,
Alabama, and Arkansas.

[table 3 Weekly deaths per capita]

I suspect epidemiologists are still viewing all of this as the first covid wave, simply taking it's time
to reach different communities in the US.
