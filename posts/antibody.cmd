# New York antibody tests

This week, [New York City](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/19/nyregion/new-york-city-antibody-test.html) released the results of extensive COVID antibody testing. For New York City, over 21% of residents tested positive for COVID. I've used this data point to increase my [probable case](#posts.activecases) multiple from 5 to 8.

The weekly death count has come down slightly overall and the top states are dropping, but if sorting the table by weekly risers and you'll see fresh hot spots.
