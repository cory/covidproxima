# Where are US covid deaths happening?

As covid surges in different parts of the US, one way to understand how trends are changing
is to split counties by where deaths are increasing or decreasing now and graph those totals
back in time.

[line 1]

This graph shows that counties with increasing deaths now weren't part of the initial covid
spike back in April and May. Those early counties are generally declining today, while
counties that didn't contribute to deaths earlier are now growing rapidly.

Another way to cut it is to look at how many counties were showing increasing or decreasing
weekly deaths. What is surprising is for the majority of pandemic -- including the early
reopnings -- more US counties has increasing weekly death rates than decreasing.

[line 2]

Why hasn't that been obvious? Because the contribution of the increasing versus decreasing counties
had been so dominated by the early counties -- New York and the Northeast -- that it obscured the breadth
of growth across the rest of the US.
