# How do states from the early criss compare to now?

New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Illinois, Pennsylvania, and Michigan were hit hard early in the crisis,
while Texas[1], Florida, Arizona, South Carolina, Georgia,
and California have been on a longer, slower trajectory. How do their weekly death totals compare to each other?

Either way, it is clear the early states had a very different covid experience compared to the later states.
