# The Florida Gamble

On Friday, Florida Governor Rick DeSantis [ended](https://www.clickorlando.com/news/local/2020/09/25/florida-moving-to-phase-3-of-coronavirus-reopening-restaurants-can-operate-at-full-capacity/) state-wide
restaurant seating restrictions.

So far, Florida has reported [text 1] deaths from COVID-19, although that number is almost certainly low.
Examining [excess death statistics](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/05/us/coronavirus-death-toll-us.html),
Florida has over 20,000 excess deaths through early September.

More relevant, as of late September, Florida leads the nation in weekly deaths.

Nor do those deaths appear to be ending.

So, this is a big gamble with the lives of Florida's citizens. How much economic stimulus will opening up generate
and will the excess deaths be worth it?

For the curious, in that restaurant with 50 people? There's a [text 4] chance one of them is currently
infectuous. Please be careful.
