# How does poverty change the impact of covid?

Using either pre-covid unemployent levels or census poverty data as the signal, America's poorest counties are significantly more likely to encounter currently infectuous people. The amazing USDA Economic Research Service [Atlas of Rural and Small Town America](https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/atlas-of-rural-and-small-town-america/) has both 2018 poverty rates and 2019 unemployment rates per county.

In the highest poverty counties in America, groups are more than twice as likely to contain an infectuous person.

2019 unemployment rates show a similar divide, whch isn't surprising as I would expect the 2018 poverty and 2019 unemployment
data to tell similar stories.
