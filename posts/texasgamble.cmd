# The Texas Gamble

On Friday, Texas Governor Mike abott [ended](https://gov.texas.gov/news/post/governor-abbott-lifts-mask-mandate-opens-texas-100-percent)
state-wide mask and capacity restrictions, saying Texas is open "100%."

So far, Texas has reported [text 1] deaths from COVID-19, although that number is almost certainly low.
Examining [excess death statistics](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/01/14/us/covid-19-death-toll.html),
Texas' excess death total is 28% higher than reported COVID deaths,ranking as one of the most under-reported states
in the country.

Despite that massive undercounting, Texas has the 3rd most deaths in the country and gaining on NY.

And now it is opening.

You might expect to see deaths continuing to fall rapidly from the winter peak, but you would be wrong. They are quite flat in Teas.

Similarly, positive tests are also high -- nearly at the level of last summer's peak.

Please be careful, Texas friends. In your unmasked, unlimited group of 50, here are the odds at least one person has COVID.
