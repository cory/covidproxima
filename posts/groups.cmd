# How likely are groups to have an infectious person in them?

If you start from a guess about how many [infetious people](#posts.activecases) there currently are,
you can compute how likely groups are to contain an infectious person.

Overall, the probability of a group of 10 people in the US having at least one infectious person is [text 1]. It varies quite a bit across [entry 2].
Note that you can click on the "the United States" and then either scroll to select another state or type in a state name, zipcode, county name,
or city to search inside the US.

Larger groups are *much* more likely to have an infectious person present. The map below is for groups of 50.
